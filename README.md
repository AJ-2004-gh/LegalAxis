# Covenant-AI
Covenant AI is an agentic legal co-pilot that keeps contracts compliant, tracks obligations, flags risks, negotiates fair terms, simulates dispute outcomes, ensures cross-document consistency, and links clauses to real legal sources. A multi-agent system turns static legal text into proactive and automated workflows for businesses and individuals.
