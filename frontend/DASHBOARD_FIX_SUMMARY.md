# Dashboard Card Text Squeezing Fix

## Issue
The dashboard agent cards were experiencing text squeezing when the sidebar was open in desktop mode, making the content difficult to read and poorly formatted.

## Root Cause
- The original grid layout used fixed breakpoint columns (`md:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-3`) that didn't account for the reduced available space when the sidebar was expanded
- Text wasn't properly wrapping in constrained spaces
- Card heights and content sizing weren't optimized for the sidebar layout

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Responsive Grid System (`src/index.css`)
```css
.dashboard-grid {
  display: grid;
  gap: 1rem;
}

/* Adaptive columns based on available space */
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .dashboard-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(320px, 1fr));
  }
}

@media (min-width: 1280px) {
  .dashboard-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  }
}

@media (min-width: 1536px) {
  .dashboard-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr));
  }
}
```

### 2. Improved AgentCard Component (`src/components/agents/AgentCard.jsx`)
- **Responsive sizing**: Different min-heights and font sizes for different breakpoints
- **Better text wrapping**: Added `break-words` and proper text overflow handling
- **Flexible metrics layout**: Changed from `sm:grid-cols-2` to `xl:grid-cols-2` for metrics
- **Responsive typography**: Font sizes that scale appropriately with container size

### 3. Layout Container Fix (`src/components/layout/Layout.jsx`)
- Removed `container` class that was constraining the content
- Used `max-w-full` to allow content to use available space properly

### 4. Dashboard Grid Update (`src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`)
- Replaced fixed Tailwind grid classes with custom `dashboard-grid` class
- Grid now adapts fluidly to available space regardless of sidebar state

## Key Improvements

1. **Auto-fit Grid**: Uses `repeat(auto-fit, minmax())` to automatically adjust column count based on available space
2. **Minimum Card Width**: Ensures cards never get too narrow (320px, 300px, 280px at different breakpoints)
3. **Proper Text Wrapping**: Added CSS classes and Tailwind utilities for better text flow
4. **Responsive Typography**: Font sizes that scale with container size
5. **Flexible Metrics**: Metrics stack vertically on smaller cards, side-by-side on larger ones

## Result
- Cards maintain readable text at all screen sizes
- No more text squeezing when sidebar is open
- Smooth transitions between different layout states
- Better space utilization across all device types
- Improved visual hierarchy and readability

The dashboard now provides a consistently excellent user experience whether the sidebar is collapsed or expanded on desktop devices.
